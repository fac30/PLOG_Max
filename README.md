# Progress Log

## The purpose of the Progress Log
Throughout your time on the 15 week training block, all students are required to keep a Progress Log as part of the programme. 
The purpose of the progress log is to enable students to reflect on their learning week by week, identify strengths and areas for development, and to receive feedback on their progress from the Course Facilitators in order to improve.  

This progress log must be **updated every Friday** as a reflection activity on the previous week's learning outcomes and **ready for review by Monday morning**.

## Using this template
Follow these steps to create your own Progress Log:
- Click 'Use this template' and select 'Create a new repository'
- Rename the new repository following this convention: **PLOG_your-name**

Every week, update the file linked for that week with your reflections and examples of your learnings.
On the following Monday, the Founders and Coders team will review your update and record feedback.
